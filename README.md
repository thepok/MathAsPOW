# MathAsPOW

Idea
use research in Mathematics as Proof of Work in a Cryptocurrency.

Proof of Work by finding a Solution to a Problem must hard to generate but easy to verify. In Bitcoins its of the Form: Find a x for that Hash(x)<k.

Proofs for Mathematical Hypotheses are of the same quality, increasingly Hard to get, but once found, easy to verify ( if written in a Computerreadable form).
Finding shorter Proofs is hard to, but easy verrifable. Good POW too.

Problems:
Not so easy to time the finding of Solutions
//Hybrid of common POW and MathPOW.
How to generate new Problems (Hypotheses)
When a shorter Proof is found, it could be artifical made longer, to resubmit it later a little bit shorter again...
//minimum of shortening maybe in percent or a reward porportional to the optimazation.
-Problem, a new Theorem is proofen. The submitted proof may be artifical made longer, to resubmit shorter proofs.
//Maximum of reward per proof, its partially payed out, depending od proofsize. So no gain in stepwise releasing a proof. (others could find shorter prof in meantime too)

advantages:
POW thats usefull.
POW thats executable by Humans! Realy Democratic.
POW that fosters research in automatic Theoremproofing.

//ideas i need more knowledge:
Generalizations of multiple theorems into one could be POW?

Details:

Its Possible to Proof most of all known Math from Just some Axioms and Definitions on Settheorie. These Proofs can be written down in Computercomprehensible form in Metamath (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamath). The Project arround Methamath tries to Proof all Math without Gaps. A quite big Database off allready proofen Theorems exists, that could be optimized. This would be POW-Mathoptimization. Adding new Proofs to the Database would be POW-Mathresearch.

This could be implemented into Bitcoin, its the most Valueable chain, and so would create most gain for research. As Sidechain, or in the Mainchain as an Additional kind of POW.
